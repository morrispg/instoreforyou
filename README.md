# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## My Task

My primary goal was to increase my skills of CRUD implementation. It presented many challenges. I was able to seed the database and interact through MySQL, but some of the routes never became functional. This is an opportunity for me to revisit and sharpen my skills.

This was great experience to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Using Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database was a good skill.
